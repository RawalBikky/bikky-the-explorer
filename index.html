      <h3><a href="posts/post1.html">Why I Started This Blog</a></h3>
      <p class="meta">Posted on April 15th, 2025</p>
      <p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by machines and motorcycles. I used to take apart my toys just to understand how they worked — that curiosity soon turned into an unwavering passion for bikes and travel. Over the years, I realized I wanted to share this passion with others.</p>
      <p>That’s how "Bikky the Explorer" was born — a space where I teach people how to maintain their bikes, share practical travel tips, and help fellow explorers save time and money on their journeys. This blog is a reflection of what I love to learn and what I’m excited to share with you.</p>
